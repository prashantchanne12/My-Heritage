# Travel Begins Here

## Hackathon Project

## Problem Statment
Every part of our country is very rich in its heritage and culture. However, awareness about the same can be increased among the local residents. Tangible heritage refers to physical artefacts, transmitted intergenerationally in a society and intangible heritage are skills, knowledge, practices, etc. We are looking for software-mobile app for increasing awareness among local residents as well as at national level, leading to an increase in ownership among locals and stimulus to tourism.
